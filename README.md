build_radius_groupings
======================

A simple series of PHP classes for building "Zoom Level," groupings from database rows with Latitude and Longitude values. This runs a series of trig functions to determine the distance of a primary row from all the other rows in the database and builds an array of arrays grouped accordingly. It currently creates 7 zoom levels.

I hope this comes in handy!
