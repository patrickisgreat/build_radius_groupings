build_radius_groupings
======================

A simple PHP class for building "Zoom Level," groupings from database rows with Latitude and Longitude values. 


The queries in the following methods can be updated to your table name and field names. The object is instantiated with the DB host, User, PW, and table to use -- this is in the constructor method. 

The buildRadians method can add new records to existing groups and regroup deletions.

I hope this comes in handy!
